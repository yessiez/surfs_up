    "<i>Your next meeting with W. Avy is coming up soon, so you are eager to start analyzing! Impressing him is your one-way ticket to Oahu. You know that your analysis can only be as good as your data, so the first step is to make sure you have the data downloaded correctly so that you can start exploring it.</i>\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Here's what we'll need to get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Jupyter notebook file:</b> we will continue to use Jupyter Notebook for our weather analysis. The name of the file is <code>climate_analysis.ipynb</code>. This file will have all of the structure to help you get started on your analysis. Let's get started by downloading the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>SQLite database:</b> W. Avy has stored the weather data in a SQLite database. All SQLite databases are <b>flat files</b>, which means that they don't have relationships that connect the data to anything else. As a result, flat files can be stored locally, which will help us move more quickly through the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now download the SQL database and dataset to your class folder by clicking the links below:\n",
    "\n",
    "    climate_analysis.ipynb \n",
    "\n",
    "    hawaii.sqlite \n",
    "    \n",
    "# 9.1.2: Prepare Your Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>Once your database is downloaded, it's a good idea to check and make sure you have the right tools in place. Without the tools to analyze it, the data won't do us much good.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll kick our analysis off by checking on three tools: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, and GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Jupyter Notebook</b>\n",
    "The first tool we'll check on is Jupyter Notebook. As you already know, Jupyter notebook files are great for sharing code. Since Jupyter Notebook is run in a browser, you will be able to easily share your analysis with W. Avy. All investors will need to do is download the file and run the code you provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check that you have Jupyter Notebook installed by viewing your Applications folder. Open Terminal (on Mac) or Command Prompt (on Windows) and run the command <code>jupyter --version</code>. If a version number is returned (any version number is fine) you're good to go. If a version number is not returned, you'll need to reinstall the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>VS Code</b>\n",
    "We'll also be using VS Code in this module to create our Flask application. To make sure you have it installed, go to the Anaconda Navigator application and check the list of applications within the Navigator. If you do not see it in the list, go ahead and install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda Navigator menu screen with the VS Code located at the top center row\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>GitHub</b>\n",
    "We'll be using GitHub to store our code, so you should create a new repository for this project. Let's name it \"surfs_up.\" Remember to commit your code early and often!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### REWIND\n",
    "To create a new repository on GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Give the repository the name \"surfs_up.\"\n",
    "    - (Optional) Add a brief description of the repository and what type of programming software you are using for this project.\n",
    "2. Make the repository public.\n",
    "3. Click \"Initialize this repository with a README.\" \n",
    "    - Each GitHub repo has a README file that serves as a kind of homepage for the repository. \n",
    "    - This is where you can add a description of your project. \n",
    "        - We will add a description at the end of this module.\n",
    "4. Click \"Add .gitignore\" and type \"Python.\"\n",
    "5. Click the green \"Create repository\" box. After clicking \"Create repository,\" you'll be on the homepage of your repository. Once you are back, you will want to copy the HTTP link to the repo from the \"Clone or download\" green button.\n",
    "6. To clone the \"surfs_up\" repository to your computer, run the following command. Make sure to add your HTTP github repo link.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE\n",
    "Before running this command, make sure you're in the local directory that you want your code to go in.\n",
    "\n",
    "    git clone < github link > \n",
    "    \n",
    "Now make sure that the clone was successful. To do this, navigate through your local file system and check that the surfs_up folder is in the correct place.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9.1.3: Import Dependencies\n",
    "<i>As soon as you finish downloading the SQLite database and checking that your tools are ready to go, your phone buzzes—it's a text from W. Avy! It reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Aloha! Thinking about the surf shop—excited to see what you come up with. Also, thinking longer term, if the shop on Oahu does well, we could expand to other islands.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You fire back a quick response: \"Yes! I'll keep the code documented so we won't have to duplicate efforts in the future.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning back to your computer, you're ready to take the next step: import the dependencies. You make a mental note to comment out your code.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the data downloaded and our tools set up, we can import all the dependencies we'll need. Some will be new, others you might have used before. You will be writing your code in the provided Jupyter notebook file, <code>climate_analysis.ipynb</code>. Go ahead and open this Jupyter notebook using your command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Dependencies</b> are previously written snippets of code that we can then use in our code. Dependencies save us tons of time because we don't have to write every line of code ourselves. Instead, we just import the dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies can be provided by companies or other programmers or analysts, or they can be from code you wrote previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matplotlib Dependencies\n",
    "The first dependency we will need to import is Matplotlib, as we'll need to graph the results of our analysis to show investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib's dependency contains code that allows you to plot data. There are many different kinds of plots you can create; for this project, we'll use the \"fivethirtyeight\" style. This style essentially tries to replicate the style of the graphs from FiveThirtyEight.com. (There are other style types too—if a different style catches your eye, feel free to use it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE:\n",
    "For more information about fivethirtyeight style, see this FiveThirtyEight style sheet (https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/style_sheets/fivethirtyeight.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by running the following code. This will import style from Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from matplotlib import style\n",
    "    \n",
    "Next, we'll add the specific style we want, fivethirtyeight. Add this line to your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to add the pyplot module, a dependency that provides us with a MATLAB-like plotting framework. Go ahead and add this to your code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    \n",
    "Next, we'll add NumPy and Pandas as dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NumPy and Pandas Dependencies\n",
    "We will need to use a few standard dependencies for our code. Go ahead and import NumPy and Pandas dependencies with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll import datetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datetime Dependencies\n",
    "We'll use datetime in this module because we'll need to calculate some data points that have to do with dates. To import datetime, run the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import datetime as dt\n",
    "    \n",
    "Good work! Finally, we'll import a few dependencies from SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import SQLAlchemy Dependencies\n",
    "We know we want to query a SQLite database, and SQLAlchemy is the best tool to do that. So we'll need to import dependencies from SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by adding the SQLAlchemy dependency, but then we will also add the dependencies for automap, session, create_engine, and func. These dependencies will help us set up a simple database that we'll use later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following to your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import sqlalchemy\n",
    "    from sqlalchemy.ext.automap import automap_base\n",
    "    from sqlalchemy.orm import session\n",
    "    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, func\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's open the Jupyter notebook file so that we can begin exploring SQLite and SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Starter Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "Previously, we've opened Jupyter notebook files via the command line. In this module, we'll use a different method: Anaconda Navigator. There is no right or wrong way to open the file; this is just another option at your disposal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook file, <code>climate_analysis.ipynb</code>, is already downloaded in the <code>surfs_up</code> folder. \n",
    "1. Navigate to this folder.\n",
    "2. Open the Anaconda Navigator application, which you should find in the Applications folder. \n",
    "3. Find the Jupyter Notebook application icon and click it.\n",
    "4. When you click the Anaconda Navigator icon, a new command line window will open, followed by a webpage showing the files on your computer. Navigate through this file structure to find the surfs_up folder where you saved your climate_analysis.ipynb file. Click the Jupyter Notebook file to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice work! Now we're ready to explore SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9.1.4: Getting Started with SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> We'll be using SQLite to store the weather data that W. Avy shared with us and that we'll need for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know there is a slight possibility that W. Avy will ask you to duplicate this process in the future (to open other shops, or if Oahu doesn't turn out to be a good fit). So, as you work through the process of getting started with SQLite, you make a note to make sure to take your time and really understand what you are doing so that you can do it again in the future.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "SQLite provides a quick way to setup a database engine without requiring a server. It's essentially a flat file, but with most of the major capabilities of an SQL database—just like how a \"lite\" version of ice cream is basically ice cream, but with less fat.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can compare SQLite databases to a CSV or Excel file: each SQLite database can have one or more tables with columns and rows, and it is stored as a file on your computer. The key difference between SQLite databases and a CSV or Excel file is that we can write queries for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLite Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>It's local.</b> \n",
    "   - One of the core advantages of SQLite is that it allows you to create databases locally on your computer to support testing and easy prototyping. This is beneficial, because if you want to test something out and you need a database, it's not always the most convenient to set up a SQL database server just to try something out.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "<b>There's an app for that.</b> \n",
    "   - Another advantage of SQLite databases are that they can be used on a mobile phone app. Most mobile phone games will use an SQLite database to store certain information about you or your players statistics. While we won't be creating a mobile app in this module, it's still helpful to understand the full context.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLite Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>It's local.</b> \n",
    "   - If you've used a MYSQL database before, you might have noticed that you can have multiple users access the database. With SQLite, there are no users. SQL is local: stored on one computer or phone. So, only that computer or phone will have access.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>There are fewer security features:</b> \n",
    "   - One other disadvantage to be aware of is that SQLite doesn't have as many security features as a traditional SQL database. While it's not something specifically to be concerned with for this module, just keep that in mind as you create other databases later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9.1.5: Getting Started with SQLAlchemy\n",
    "In order to connect to the SQLite database, we'll use SQLAlchemy. \n",
    "   - SQLAlchemy will help us easily connect to our database where we'll store the weather data.\n",
    "   - SQLAlchemy is one of the primary technologies we will be looking at in this module. \n",
    "   - It's extremely helpful for querying databases. If you are familiar with PostgreSQL, you'll see there are many similarities to the process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLAlchemy ORM\n",
    "One of the primary features of SQLAlchemy is the <b>Object Relational Mapper,</b> which is commonly referred to as ORM. \n",
    "- ORM allows you to create classes in your code that can be mapped to specific tables in a given database. \n",
    "    - This allows us to create a special type of system called a <b>decoupled system</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand ORMs and decoupled systems, consider the following scenario:\n",
    "- Suppose you are cleaning out the garage, and you find a bunch of wires or ropes that are all knotted together. We would call this a tightly coupled system: all of the different ropes are connected to each other, so if we go to grab just one, the whole mess comes along with it. What the ORM does for us is untangle—or decouple—all of those ropes, so we can use just one of them at a time. When we pick one up, we won't pick up the whole knot; or, if one element breaks, it doesn't affect any of the other cords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, the less coupling in our code, the better. If there are a bunch of relationships between all of your coding components and one of them breaks, everything breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ORM helps us keep our systems decoupled. We'll get into more specific details about how we can keep our code decoupled, but for now, <b>just remember that your references will be to classes in your code instead of specific tables in the database, and that we'll be able to influence each class independently.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLAlchemy Create Engine\n",
    "Another really great feature of SQLAlchemy is the <code>create engine</code> function. \n",
    "- This function's primary purpose is to set up the ability to query a SQLite database. (After all, data just sitting in a database that we can't access does us no good).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to connect to our SQLite database, we need to use the <code>create_engine()</code> function. \n",
    "- This function doesn't actually connect to our database; it just prepares the database file to be connected to later on.\n",
    "- This function will typically have one parameter, which is the location of the SQLite database file. Try this function by adding the following line to your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "        engine = create_engine(\"sqlite:///hawaii.sqlite\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "We've got our engine created—good work! Next we're going to reflect our existing database into a new model with the <code>automap_base()</code> function. \n",
    "- Reflecting a database into a new model essentially means to transfer the contents of the database into a different structure of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLAlchemy Automap Base\n",
    "<b>Automap Base</b> creates a base class for an automap schema in SQLAlchemy. Basically, it sets up a foundation for us to build on in SQLAlchemy, and by adding it to our code, it will help the rest of our code to function properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for your code to function properly, you will need to add this line to your code (You don't need to run your code quite yet—we'll do that in the next section).:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Base = automap_base()\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLAlchemy Reflect Tables\n",
    "Now that we've gotten our environment set up for SQLAlchemy, we can reflect our tables with the <code>prepare()</code> function. \n",
    "- By adding this code, we'll reflect the schema of our SQLite tables into our code and create mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IMPORTANT\n",
    "Remember when we talked about keeping our code decoupled? When we reflect tables, we create classes that help keep our code separate. This ensures that our code is separated such that if other classes or systems want to interact with it, they can interact with only specific subsets of data instead of the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code to reflect the schema from the tables to our code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Base.prepare(engine, reflect=True)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now that we've reflected our database tables, we can check out the classes we'll be creating with Automap.\n",
    "\n",
    "## View Classes Found by Automap\n",
    "Once we have added the <code>base.prepare()</code> function, we should confirm that the Automap was able to find all of the data in the SQLite database. We will double-check this by using <code>Base.classes.keys()</code>. This code references the classes that were mapped in each table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - <code>Base.classes</code> gives us access to all the classes.\n",
    "   - <code>keys()</code> references all the names of the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IMPORTANT\n",
    "Previously, we talked about decoupled systems in the SQLAlchemy ORM. This directly relates to the classes we have created here. These classes help keep our data separate, or decoupled. Keep in mind that our data is no longer stored in tables, but rather in classes. The code we will run below enables us to essentially copy, or reflect, our data into different classes instead of database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Base.classes.keys()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've viewed all of our classes, we can create references to each table.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Save References to Each Table\n",
    "In order to reference a specific class, we use <code>Base.classes.<class name> </code>."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "For example, if we wanted to reference the station class, we would use <code>Base.classes.station</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it can be rather cumbersome to type <code>Base.classes</code> every time we want to reference the measurement or station classes, we can give the classes new variable names. In this case, we will create new references for our <code>Measurement</code> class and <code>Station class</code>. Add these new variables to your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Measurement = Base.classes.measurement\n",
    "    Station = Base.classes.station\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now that we have our references saved to some new variables, let's work on creating a session link to our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create Session Link to the Database\n",
    "Let's create a session link to our database with our code. First, we'll use an SQLAlchemy Session to query our database. Our session essentially allows us to query for data.\n",

    "    session = Session(engine)\n",

    "<i>Your dependencies are added, you've connected the SQLite database, and your code is appropriately documented. It's time to start the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's think about precipitation. W. Avy is concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that you can set W. Avy's mind at ease by analyzing precipitation levels and showing him the cold, hard, data that backs up Oahu as the perfect place to surf. You have the last 12 months of precipitation data already loaded into your SQLite database, so you are ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "W. Avy supplied you with the data he wants us to use and has asked you to look at a full year of data. When deciding how to parse the data, you remember that his favorite day is August 23, 2017 because it's the anniversary of the first time he ever went surfing and had ice cream on the same day. So, you decide to start the analysis there.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the weather database, let's calculate the date one year from August 23, 2017. We'll be creating a variable called <code>prev_year</code> and using the datetime dependency that we imported previously.\n",

    "Add the most recent date, August 23, 2017, with the following code:\n",

    "    prev_year = dt.date(2017, 8, 23)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This code specifies the most recent date, but we want to calculate the date one year back. \n",
    "- To do this, add the <code>dt.timedelta()</code> function to the previous line of code. \n",
    "    - This function allows us to trace back a certain number of days. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we've got our date from the previous year (August 23, 2016), let's retrieve the amount of precipitation that was recorded, or the <b>precipitation score.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieve the Precipitation Scores\n",
    "We'll begin by creating a variable to store the results of the query we'll write. This variable will be called results:\n",
    "\n",
    "    results = []\n",
    "    \n",
    "This code defines our new variable. Next, let's add our session that we created earlier so that we can query our database. For this we'll use the <code>session.query()</code> function, which is how we'll begin all of our queries in SQLAlchemy. From a bird's-eye view, this is how we query a SQLite database using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>session.query()</code> function for this query will take two parameters. We will reference the Measurement table using <code>Measurement.date</code> and <code>Measurement.prcp</code>. Add the following to your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    results = session.query(Measurement.date, Measurement.prcp)\n",

I doubt they even know what GitHub is, much less how to use it.\"\n",

    "You pause to think. W. Avy has a point; the board of directors probably doesn't really care about the mechanics of the code you've written. They just want to be able to access the results. You respond, \"I got this, W. Avy. Just leave it to me. I'll use Flask, which will let me display my results in a webpage. All you have to do is provide your board with the URL.\"</i>\n",

    "\n",
    "#### NOTE\n",
    "Flask is also helpful when it comes to the job search. You can share your work in a web interface which is simple and effective, rather than viewing code on GitHub. Many employers will want to see your code, but more importantly, they want to see what it can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your audience is a key factor when it comes to data visualization. There may be people in your audience who are not interested in the code itself, but rather what the code can do. Flask makes it possible to summarize the key ideas of your code in a way that allows people who don't have as much coding experience to understand the results of your code. We'll create a Flask application that will allow us to share our findings in an easy-to-interpret way.\n",

Avy finish your breakfast quickly and grab an extra coffee to go—you want to get to work building the Flask application so that it's foolproof for the board of directors' meeting tomorrow. You know the first thing you must figure out is how many routes your application needs.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "Routes are a core Flask concept. They can be tricky to build (we'll get into that in a moment) but conceptually they are straightforward. In fact, you use routes whenever you google something, for example. If you search for \"surfing,\" you get a number of different categories of pages offered to you: images, maps, news, videos, and more.\n",

    "<i>You need to get to work! You get out your laptop—it's time to install Flask and get acquainted with how to programmatically create a Flask route.</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to set up Flask and then get started on creating our first Flask route. When creating a Flask application, we'll need to do a few things first. Here's our course of action:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Flask.\n",
    "2. Create a new Python file.\n",
    "3. Import the Flask dependency.\n",
    "4. Create a new Flask app instance.\n",
    "5. Create Flask routes.\n",
    "6. Run a Flask app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Flask\n",
    "You can install Flask by running the following in the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install flask\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you already have Flask installed, the output of your code will show that you have already installed many of the components, if not all of them. Running this command will ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of Flask.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to ensure that we have the right environment in order for Flask to run properly. To do this, we will need to make a change in VS Code. We just need to select the PythonData environment we created in previous modules. To do this, click on \"Select Python Interpreter,\" then select the PythonData environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IMPORTANT\n",
    "Some users may need an additional package installed for this section. In your terminal, run the following code: pip install psycopg2-binary to add it to your coding environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a New Python File and Import the Flask Dependency\n",
    "Create a new Python file called <code>app.py</code>. You should create this file in VS Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Python file is created, we can import the dependency we need. This dependency will enable your code to access all that Flask has to offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To import the Flask dependency, add the following to your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a New Flask App Instance\n",
    "We're now ready to create a new Flask app instance. \"Instance\" is a general term in programming to refer to a singular version of something. Add the following to your code to create a new Flask instance called app:\n",
    "\n",
    "    app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### IMPORTANT\n",
    "You probably noticed the __name__ variable inside of the <code>Flask()</code> function. Let's pause for a second and identify what's going on here.\n",
    "\n",
    "This __name__ variable denotes the name of the current function. You can use the __name__ variable to determine if your code is being run from the command line or if it has been imported into another piece of code. Variables with underscores before and after them are called magic methods in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create Flask Routes\n",
    "Our Flask app has been created—let's create our first route!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to define the starting point, also known as the root. To do this, we'll use the function @app.route('/'). Add this to your code now.\n",
    "\n",
    "    @app.route('/')\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE\n",
    "Notice the forward slash inside of the app.route? This denotes that we want to put our data at the root of our routes. The forward slash is commonly known as the highest level of hierarchy in any computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, create a function called hello_world(). Whenever you make a route in Flask, you put the code you want in that specific route below @app.route(). Here's what it will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    @app.route('/')\n",
    "    def hello_world():\n",
    "        return 'Hello world'\n",
    "        \n",
    "Great job! You have just created your first Flask route! Now that we have some code, let's keep running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Run a Flask App\n",
    "The process of running a Flask app is a bit different from how we've run Python files. To run the app, we're first going to need to use the command line to navigate to the folder where we've saved our code. You should save this code in the same folder you've used in the rest of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've ensured that your code is saved in the proper directory, then run the following command if you are on a Mac. This command sets the <code>FLASK_APP</code> environment variable to the name of our Flask file, <code>app.py</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTE\n",
    "Environment variables are essentially dynamic variables in your computer. They are used to modify the way a certain aspect of the computer operates. For our FLASK_APP environment variable, we want to modify the path that will run our <code>app.py</code> file so that we can run our file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    export FLASK_APP=app.py\n",
    "\n",
    "There won't be any output when you run this command, so don't worry if you don't see anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are on a Windows computer, you will need to do the same thing, but in a slightly different way. Start by opening up Anaconda Powershell. Once you've done that, enter this command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    set FLASK_APP=app.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now let's run our Flask app. To do this, type the following command in your command line and press Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "    flask run\n",
    "    \n",
    "When you run this command, you'll notice a line that says \"Running on\" followed by an address. This should be your localhost address and a port number.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A port number is essentially the endpoint of a given program or service. Any Flask application you create can have whatever port number you would like, but the most common is 5000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy and paste your localhost address into your web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a localhost will look something like this, for context.\n",
    "\n",
    "    localhost:5000\n",
    "    \n",
    "This is what you should see:\n",
    "\n",
    "A webpage showing the text \"Hello world\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You ran your first Flask app! You should feel ready to create more routes that incorporate our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some extra practice, let's create another route in the following Skill Drill.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SKILL DRILL\n",
    "Think of some simple code from which you could create a route. Then try to create a new route implementing that logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ADD/COMMIT/PUSH\n",
    "Great work on the Flask app. Now is a good time to add, commit, and push your updates to GitHub. Remember these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. git add < FILE NAME>\n",
